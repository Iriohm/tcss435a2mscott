Open playerfirst.html in a browser window, or aifirst.html if you want the AI to 
make the first move. From there, place pieces by pointing and clicking with the 
cursor. Rotate the quadrants when appropriate using the arrow buttons around the 
game board. The AI's last move will be displayed at the right, as well as whether 
the game is won, lost, or tied. You may also switch colors if you like.
